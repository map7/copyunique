* Copy Unique

Only copy files which I don't already have.

: copyunique <source> <dest>

1. Build a list of filenames recursively throughout the <dest>
2. Use this to compare the current file you are going to copy over from source
3. If it doesn't exist anywhere in the <dest> then copy it to the base directory.
